## App folder
This folder contains the files that partially worked with some queries.

## Client folder
This folder was expected to contain a simple HTML page with a JS script that triggered requests to the published queries.

## Data folder
Was intended to contain the clean and raw datasets. The dataset is in MongoDB since the CSV was too big for GitHub. Even a ZIP was too big.
